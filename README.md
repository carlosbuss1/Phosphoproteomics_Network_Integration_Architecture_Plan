### Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Architecture Plan

## Step 4: Enhance with Plugins

### ClueGO (Pathway Enrichment in Networks)
- **Input:** GO, KEGG, and Reactome results.
- **Process:** Load data into ClueGO and perform pathway enrichment.
- **Output:** Functional network with grouped annotations and p-values.

### OmicsIntegrator (Data Fusion from Multiple Sources)
- **Input:** Phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics datasets.
- **Process:** Use the prize-collecting Steiner tree algorithm to fuse datasets.
- **Output:** Multi-omics data fusion network.

## Step 5: Network Analysis and Interpretation

### Centrality Metrics
- **Input:** Functional network.
- **Process:** Calculate degree centrality and betweenness centrality.
- **Output:** Identification of hub proteins with key regulatory roles.

### Community Detection
- **Input:** Functional network.
- **Process:** Apply Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) to identify groups of co-modified proteins.
- **Output:** Detection of protein clusters based on shared phosphorylation patterns.

### Pathway Overlaps
- **Input:** Functional network.
- **Process:** Analyze pathways for overlap involving multiple phosphorylation types.
- **Output:** Highlighted pathways with shared regulatory mechanisms.

## Step 6: Export Results

- **Export:** Generate the network as an image or interactive file.
- **Save:** Export node and edge tables with metadata for downstream analysis.
- **Documentation:** Record all analytical steps and settings for reproducibility.
