Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Architecture Plan
Step 4: Enhance with Plugins
    |
    |---> ClueGO (Pathway Enrichment)
    |         - Input: GO, KEGG, Reactome
    |         - Process: Perform pathway enrichment
    |         - Output: Functional network with grouped annotations
    |
    |---> OmicsIntegrator (Data Fusion)
              - Input: Phosphoproteomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics
              - Process: Apply Steiner tree algorithm
              - Output: Multi-omics data fusion network
              
Step 5: Network Analysis and Interpretation
    |
    |---> Centrality Metrics
    |         - Calculate degree and betweenness centrality
    |         - Identify hub proteins
    |
    |---> Community Detection (MCL)
    |         - Identify co-modified protein clusters
    |
    |---> Pathway Overlaps
              - Highlight pathways involving multiple phosphorylation types
              
Step 6: Export Results
    |
    |---> Export as image or interactive file
    |---> Save node and edge tables with metadata
