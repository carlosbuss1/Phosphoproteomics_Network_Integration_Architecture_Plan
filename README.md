### Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Strategy

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Collect phosphoproteomics data for Tyrosine, Serine, and Threonine.
- Perform KEGG pathway enrichment for each modification type.

**Step 2: Network Construction**
- Use ClueGO to create functional networks based on KEGG results.
- Load data into OmicsIntegrator for pathway fusion analysis focusing on Cancer and Insulin Resistance.

**Step 3: Network Analysis**
- Apply centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) to identify hub proteins.
- Perform community detection with Markov Clustering (MCL).

**Step 4: Result Export and Documentation**
- Export networks as image and interactive files.
- Save node and edge tables with metadata.
- Document all steps for reproducibility.
