### Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Strategy

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Collect phosphoproteomics datasets for Tyrosine, Serine, and Threonine modifications, ensuring quantitative values and protein annotations are included.
- Perform KEGG pathway enrichment analysis separately for each modification type, focusing on statistically significant pathways (e.g., adjusted p-value < 0.05).

**Step 2: Network Construction**
- Use ClueGO in Cytoscape to generate functional protein networks based on enriched KEGG pathways.
- Upload the enriched protein sets into OmicsIntegrator, using a protein-protein interaction (PPI) database (e.g., STRING or BioGRID) for pathway fusion analysis.
- Prioritize key pathways such as Cancer and Insulin Resistance for deeper exploration.

**Step 3: Network Analysis**
- Apply centrality metrics (degree centrality and betweenness centrality) to identify hub proteins critical for pathway regulation.
- Use the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) to detect clusters of co-modified proteins.
- Investigate pathway overlaps by comparing significant proteins shared across multiple phosphorylation types and pathways.

**Step 4: Result Export and Documentation**
- Export networks as high-resolution image files (e.g., PNG, SVG) and interactive Cytoscape sessions (.cys files).
- Save node and edge tables with quantitative data and pathway annotations for further downstream analysis.
- Document all preprocessing steps, analysis parameters, and tools used to ensure reproducibility.
