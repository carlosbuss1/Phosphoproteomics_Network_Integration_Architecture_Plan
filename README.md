### Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Strategy (Focused on Common Phospho Modifications)

## Step 1: Data Preparation
- Collect phosphoproteomics datasets for Tyrosine, Serine, and Threonine modifications.
- Perform KEGG pathway enrichment separately for each modification type.
- Identify phosphosites and proteins **common** across all datasets (intersection analysis).

## Step 2: Identification of Common Phospho Proteins
- Create a **Venn diagram** to visualize shared phosphoproteins and modifications.
- Filter for proteins and pathways enriched in multiple datasets.
- Prioritize proteins modified on **multiple sites** or across all phospho types.

## Step 3: Network Construction (Integrating Shared Proteins)
- Generate a **shared protein interaction network** using Cytoscape's ClueGO:
   - **Nodes:** Proteins/phosphosites enriched across all datasets.
   - **Edges:** Protein-protein interactions and shared pathway memberships.
- Upload common proteins into **OmicsIntegrator** with STRING/BioGRID data for fusion analysis.
- Highlight proteins co-modified in **key pathways** (e.g., Cancer, Insulin Resistance).

## Step 4: Network Analysis
- Apply **centrality metrics** to identify core hub proteins modified across phosphorylation types.
- Perform **community detection** using Markov Clustering (MCL) on the shared network.
- Investigate **pathway overlaps** for functional relationships across Tyrosine, Serine, and Threonine.

## Step 5: Export and Visualization
- Export **combined networks** showing common phosphoproteins across modifications.
- Save node and edge tables with annotation details for downstream analysis.
- Provide **pathway-focused heatmaps** for a clearer biological interpretation.

### **Key Advantages:**
- Focuses on **conserved signaling events** across modifications.
- Reduces noise by emphasizing **shared biological processes**.
- Highlights **cross-modification regulation** in complex pathways.
