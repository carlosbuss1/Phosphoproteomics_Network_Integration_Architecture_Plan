### Phosphoproteomics Network Integration Strategy

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Collect phosphoproteomics datasets for Tyrosine, Serine, and Threonine.
- Perform KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.

**→**

**Step 2: Network Construction**
- Generate functional protein networks using ClueGO.
- Upload data into OmicsIntegrator with PPI databases (e.g., STRING, BioGRID).
- Focus on pathways like Cancer and Insulin Resistance.

**→**

**Step 3: Network Analysis**
- Apply centrality metrics to identify hub proteins.
- Detect protein clusters using Markov Clustering (MCL).
- Investigate pathway overlaps across phosphorylation types.

**→**

**Step 4: Result Export and Documentation**
- Export networks as image files and Cytoscape sessions.
- Save node and edge tables with metadata.
- Document all steps and settings for reproducibility.
